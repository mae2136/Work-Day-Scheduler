# Week 5 Assignment - Work Day Scheduler
## Repository to create a planner of daily events for the working day.

Welcome to my work day scheduler readme. This repository contains the code for my work day scheduler site. The initial commit has the base code (index.html and style.css) that was provided by my boot camp at Northwestern University. Otherwise, the javascript and parts of the index.html were all written by me.

## Installation

No installation is required to use or see this site. Follow the link below to see my work in action.

## Usage
This repository can only be viewed at the following link: [Work Day Scheduler](https://mae2136.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)

It should look like the following:

It has the following functionality:

```
Allows a user to type in events in to each hourly time block for a normal 9-5 job. 

The site also allows you to save your event, and populate your previously saved events on reload.

The site will clear your event list the next day.

Finally, the site will tell you whether an event has already passed, whether it is currently happening, or whether an event is in the future.
```

## Credits
I would like to thank my wife, Amanda, for letting me talk through my solution at her. It probably sounds like a bunch of gibberish to her, but helps me immensely.

I would also like to credit my teacher, teaching assistant, and current classmates at Northwestern bootcamp for providing me the resources to practice and create a the website you see here. They provided the index.html and style.css so I could focus on the Javascript portion of this website.
